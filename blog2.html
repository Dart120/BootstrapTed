                    <p>For some people, the new decade brings a slurry of targets and resolutions; a new way of doing things, a step towards the pursuit of better self-perception. For others, the thoughts are rather sobering. A new era accompanied by a cynical pessimism of their outlook of the world: climate change, political instability, social inequality and the consequences that these issues bring with them.<br> 
                        What unites us however, is our day-to-day experiences of the simple, more tedious and ordinary bits of life. These are the routinely necessary tasks that fill up our day and seem endless.<br>
                        We are a world full of people with different iterations in personalities, traits, idiosyncrasies, likes and dislikes. We navigate the dauntingly unfamiliar territory of changes in different ways. James Veitch is a comedian who’s known for his whimsical exploits on the internet, in turn recording it and presenting to a TEDx audience in a visual format. His 2016 TED talk “the agony of trying to unsubscribe” is a farcical approach to unwanted spam mail.<br>
                        A legally-bound unnamed supermarket, whose name Veitch placeholders as ‘SafeMart’ bombards him with emails regarding an upcoming store opening. The ordinary person – you and me – would delete this email and relegate it to spam. Veitch doesn’t, he goes as far as to reply to the email demanding a ‘bouncy castle’ and an array of festivities to coincide with the opening. To the Safemart employee Dan’s confusion, he perplexedly replies to this over-excitable email with “I’ve asked a colleague to help me with your query.” This isn’t the end.<br>
                        Veitch continues and reignites the conversation to a point where the farcical commotion ends in him writing a program to instantly reply to Dan’s emails. The talk ends with the current ‘support email’ ticket at #21,439.<br>
                        With a world that keeps revolving and a smattering of new things and big changes heading your way, let’s remember Veitch’s approach to the moments of tedium and bore, “if you feel weighed down by the bureaucracy and mundanity of modern life, don’t fight the frustration, let it be the catalyst,” so let’s embrace change, and manoeuvre around the mundanity. Be weird, be ridiculous, be Veitch.</p>
