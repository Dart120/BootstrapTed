                            In one experiment, researchers presented kindergarteners and undergraduates with toy blocks,
                            some of which caused a machine to flash a light and play music. The children were open to
                            the idea that abnormal combinations of blocks could turn the machine on, whereas the
                            university students remained fixated on the obvious solution—that the shape of individual
                            blocks made the music play—even in the face of evidence that it was wrong. It might seem
                            strange but this is just one of a plethora of studies that show children to be better at
                            exploring unlikely possibilities, while adults are stubbornly inclined to build on existing
                            knowledge. In a way, children are more skillful scientists, open to novel hypotheses.<br>

                            This is the premise of Alison Gopnik’s TED talk “What do babies think?” She argues that
                            children are more intelligent, more subtle, and more accurate in learning than we ever
                            would’ve thought. To illuminate the ways in which our brains lose plasticity, Gopnik
                            contrasts how adult consciousness differs from that of a baby’s. Our attention functions
                            like a spotlight: what we need to focus on is vivid and everything we deem irrelevant falls
                            away. Our attention is entirely purpose driven. Babies, however, have more of a “lantern of
                            consciousness” than a spotlight. They’re considerably worse at narrowing down their
                            attention to one thing but they far exceed us in taking in a myriad of information from
                            multiple sources.<br>

                            Gopnik’s expertise in both psychology and philosophy makes for a surprisingly touching
                            exploration of perennial questions like how we become the adults that we are. Although the
                            focus is on children the talk delves into what it means to have creativity and imagination.
                            If you’re interested in how our minds work in our earliest, formative days, and what we lose
                            as we get older, this talk and the rest of Gopnik’s work is worth your time. You’ll love the
                            way she tackled these questions—her willingness to cut across conventional academic
                            subjects, her blending of qualitative and quantitative methods and her charismatic presence
                            makes for a hugely entertaining watch.<br>
