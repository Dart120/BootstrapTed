While title of this article would suggest I am a bitter shrew sick of hearing humblebrags about self-improvement in 2020, the purpose of this piece is actually to examine the psychology of achieving personal goals and why if you want to keep your humility, your resolutions… and your friends you are simply better to keep them to yourself.<br> 
Resolutions might change, but our collective failure to keep is an accepted wisdom.  Since time immemorial resolutions have been something to announce rather than fulfil. 
Now in the age of social media, there is an even bigger impetus to share our goals for the new year online. We are told sharing our ambitions will help us achieve them by offering support, motivation and accountability.<br>
Wrong. Well, according to the entrepreneur Derek Sivers and a host of psychological studies dating back to the 1920s.  
In his 2010 Ted talk “Keep your goals to yourself”, Derek Sivers argues that sharing our goals diminishes our chances of achieving them. Why? It’s all about psychology. <br>
Sivers suggests the moment we announce our goals, we feel in some way a step closer to achieving them. Lulling ourselves into a false sense of fulfilment before any of the hard work has been done.  The minute we vocalise our resolutions they become what psychologists have termed a “social reality” and the congratulations and validation we receive from others by simply stating our goals, provides a false sense of validation which inhibits further motivation.<br>
However, if you just can’t resist sharing a resolution, psychologist suggest you are better to focus on the unpleasant aspects of that goal. Rather than proclaim you are going to run a marathon and wait for the applause; simply say you are trying to reach a goal of running several times a week.<br>
To conclude, we are only four days into January and any unfulfilled resolutions can still be salvaged. So, if you are in need of inspiration and a respite from our culture of oversharing watch David Sivers.. and resolve to keep your resolutions to yourself! </p>
