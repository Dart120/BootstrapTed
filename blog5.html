                            In this inspiring talk Amy Cuddy argues body language not only affects how we are perceived by others, but directly impacts our own sense of self-confidence. By changing something as simple as posture, it is possible to alter our cortisol and testosterone levels to the extent we become more assertive, powerful and positive. This is not a hippy dippy hypothesis, but a hard-nosed scientific fact. So, if you want to know the secret of power posing and how it can affect your performance in job interviews…and dates… read on!<br>
Body language is important. This is undeniable. We make sweeping judgements every day, without realising it, based on nonverbal communication. It is strikingly evident in the animal kingdom and it’s equally obvious in the boardroom. Dominant animals and humans alike tend to make themselves as huge as possible, while those who feel threatened shrink and hang their heads. While hardly the most subtle signifiers, these well-known poses can nonetheless have dramatic impacts on our hormone levels.<br>
In a recent study two groups of people were asked to assume two different poses. The first group a high-power pose, the second a low power pose. After two minutes scientist engaged all the participants in a gambling exercise and took a sample of their saliva. Scientist found those who had assumed the high-power pose engaged more readily in gambling and experienced raised testosterone levels and reduced levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The same study was conducted again but this time the end exercise was a job interview. Those who assumed a high-power pose performed better and were more likely to be hired.<br>
So, what does this tell us? This study shows not only do our minds shape our bodies, but how we hold our bodies directly shapes the chemical balance of our minds. When we feel happy, we smile. When we are forced to smile by holding a pencil between our teeth, we experience similar happy hormonal changes!<br>

Amy Cuddy argues individuals, particularly introverts, should apply this technique of power posing in stressful situations.<br>
